 we learn about different sizes of font used in sites
 <tr><td>first you can define by using px which is absolute</td>
 <td>by using percentage which is relative to parent</td>
 <td>by using vw and vh which is relative to height and width of the site but not best pratice</td>
 <td>by using em(it is the ratio of parent to given) units which is relative to parent as easy to use or you can use rem which is relative to html</td>
 <td></td></tr>
